### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Freek Roelofs, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.
I work on imaging black holes with radio telescopes in the Event Horizon Telescope Colloboration, using the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

I developed the [SYMBA synthetic data generation pipeline](https://bitbucket.org/M_Janssen/symba/src/master/), simulating the end-to-end VLBI observation and calibration process from physical principles.

My papers are listed in my [personal ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/WH4w71_5TyiUpKd0VkprJQ)
