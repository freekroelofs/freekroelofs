### Hi there 👋
I'm Freek Roelofs, an astrophysicist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.
I work on imaging black holes with radio telescopes in the Event Horizon Telescope Colloboration, using the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

🦁 I developed the [SYMBA synthetic data generation pipeline](https://bitbucket.org/M_Janssen/symba/src/master/), simulating the end-to-end VLBI observation and calibration process from physical principles.

📡🌍📡 I coordinate the [ngEHT Analysis Challenges](https://challenge.ngeht.org/), investigating black hole imaging, movie making, and parameter inference algorithms for the Next-Generation EHT.   

📜 My papers are listed in my [personal ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/WH4w71_5TyiUpKd0VkprJQ).
